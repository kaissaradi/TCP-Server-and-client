# TCP-Server-and-client
The OTP (One-Time Pad) project is a secure communication system using one-time pad encryption. It includes a key generator, a server to handle encrypted messages, and a client to post and retrieve messages. The server stores user-specific messages, ensuring secure and concurrent handling of client requests.
